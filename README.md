# Hyperledger-Composer-AllSampleLogic
An all-in-one-place repository I made to quickly reference or borrow js logic scripts without digging through all of the Composer Sample Network folders

These JavaScript logic files are created by the Hyperledger Composer team. 

The original files can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks/tree/master/packages
including all of the model files and other .bna components for the sample networks they have created.

Only the "Authorize Read Access of Own Asset" and "Revoke Read Access of Own Asset" are my own contributions.
All other scripts are NOT my own, nor am I taking credit for them.

Because I frequently need to reference and sample JavaScript logic while learning how to code it on my own,
I made this folder to keep it all in one place to easily access. The file names have been renamed to be more
"general" to help identify them as useful in ways other than defined by their original sample network.

For example - In the perishable-network, there is a transaction for "TemperatureReading"
That was renamed to "IoT Reading Received" because the .tx names and variables can be changed so that it is
readily identifiable as a script that is flexible for any Internet of Things recording capture.
